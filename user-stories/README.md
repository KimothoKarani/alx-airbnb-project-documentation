# User Stories Documentation

This directory contains the user stories derived from our “Use Case Diagram” for the Airbnb-clone backend.

## 1. From Use Cases to User Stories

While the **Use Case Diagram** shows *what* the system can do from a functional perspective, **User Stories** reframe these functionalities from the user's point of view. They are a core component of Agile development, helping to ensure that every feature we build provides clear and tangible value to the end-user.

Each story is intentionally brief and follows a simple template:

**As a** `<type of user>`, **I want to** `<perform an action>`, **so that** `<I can achieve a goal>`.

## 2. Document Contents

The `user-stories.md` file in this directory lists the key user stories that have been derived from our primary use cases. These stories will guide the development process by focusing our efforts on meeting specific user needs for our main actors: the Guest, the Host, and the Administrator.
