# Features & Functionalities

This directory lays out every backend capability our Airbnb-clone must support.  
Below youâ€™ll find a quick feature list by category, plus a visual diagram showing how they all fit together.

## 1. Core Functionalities

These are the essential features that users will interact with.

* **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login for guests and hosts (Email/Password, OAuth, JWT).
* **Profile Management:** Allows users to update their personal information and profile photos.
* **Property Listings:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for hosts to manage their properties.
* **Search & Filtering:** Enables guests to find properties by location, price, amenities, and more.
* **Booking Management:** The core booking engine, handling reservations, preventing double-bookings, and managing status (`pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`).
* **Payment Processing:** Securely handles guest payments and host payouts via third-party gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
* **Reviews & Ratings:** Allows guests to review properties after a completed stay to build trust.
* **Notifications:** Automatic email and in-app alerts for key events like booking confirmations and new messages.
* **Messaging:** A real-time system for guests and hosts to communicate directly.
* **Admin Dashboard:** A private interface for platform administrators to manage users, listings, and bookings.

## 2. Technical Requirements

This is the tech stack and architecture used to build the features.

* **Relational Database:** A structured database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) to store all application data.
* **RESTful API Endpoints:** A logical set of API routes for the frontend to communicate with the backend.
* **JWT Auth & RBAC:** Secure user sessions with JSON Web Tokens and role-based access control to manage permissions.
* **File Storage (S3/Cloudinary):** Cloud-based storage for handling all user-uploaded images for profiles and properties.
* **Third-Party Integrations:** Connects to external services like Stripe (payments) and SendGrid (emails).
* **Error Handling & Logging:** A global system for catching errors and logging important events for debugging.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

These are the quality standards the system must meet.

* **Scalability:** Built to handle growth with load balancing and a modular design.
* **Security:** Protects user data with password hashing, data encryption, and rate limiting against attacks.
* **Performance:** Optimized for speed using database indexing and caching for frequently accessed data.
* **Testing:** Ensures reliability with a suite of unit and integration tests.
